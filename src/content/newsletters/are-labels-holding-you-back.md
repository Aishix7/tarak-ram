# Are labels holding you back?

We often define ourselves—and others—by labels. They’re shortcuts, sure, but they can also be shackles. This week, I asked myself: What labels am I carrying, and are they helping or hurting me?

Here’s what I discovered:

### 1. Labels shape our identity

When we embrace a label, it becomes part of how we see ourselves. "I’m not good at math" or "I’m not creative" can limit our potential before we even try.

### 2. Labels can be freeing—or restricting

Positive labels, like "hard-working" or "resilient," can motivate us. But negative ones often create unnecessary barriers. The key is to choose labels that empower, not constrain.

### 3. It’s okay to let labels go

You don’t have to be what others expect you to be. This week, I let go of the label "perfectionist," and it was liberating. It’s a reminder that we’re all more complex than any single word.
