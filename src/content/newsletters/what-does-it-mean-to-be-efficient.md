# What does it actually mean to be "efficient"?

We hear it all the time—"be more efficient!" But what does that really mean? This week, I took some time to reflect on the concept of efficiency and how it fits into my day-to-day life.

Efficiency isn’t just about doing more in less time; it’s about doing the _right things_ in the _right way_. It’s the balance between effort and outcome, and here’s how I learned to apply it:

### 1. Prioritize what matters

I realized that much of my day is spent on tasks that don’t actually contribute to my goals. By identifying what truly moves the needle, I was able to shift my focus and energy toward meaningful work.

### 2. Eliminate distractions

Multitasking might feel efficient, but it often leads to mistakes and frustration. By dedicating focused time to one task at a time, I found myself completing work faster—and better.

### 3. Redefine "perfection"

Perfection is the enemy of efficiency. Sometimes, "good enough" really is enough. By letting go of the need to make everything flawless, I saved time and mental energy for what truly matters.
